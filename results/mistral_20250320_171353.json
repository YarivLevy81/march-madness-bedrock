In terms of rebounding, New Mexico has a clear advantage, averaging 39.30 rebounds per game compared to Marquette's 32.50. Marquette, however, has a better defensive record, allowing only 68.50 points per game compared to New Mexico's 70.80. Both teams have similar numbers in steals and blocks, but Marquette has a slight edge in assists with 17.00 per game compared to New Mexico's 15.20.\n\n        REASONING:\n        While New Mexico has a higher scoring average and a better rebounding record, Marquette's better 3-point shooting and defensive efficiency could give them an advantage. Marquette's ability to limit their opponents' scoring and their slightly better assist record indicate a more cohesive team effort, which can be crucial in tournament play. Additionally, Marquette's higher seed suggests that they have faced and performed better against tougher competition.\n\n        PREDICTION:\n        Marquette"

            "reasoning": "The key factors in this matchup appear to be offensive efficiency, rebounding, and three-point shooting. While Auburn has a slightly better field goal percentage, Florida's higher scoring average and better three-point shooting could give them an offensive edge. Florida's rebounding strength could also provide them with more second-chance points, which could be crucial in a close game.",
            "analysis": "Both Florida and Auburn have impressive statistics, reflecting their status as number one seeds in their respective regions. Florida scores slightly more points per game (85.40) than Auburn (83.80), but Auburn has a slightly better field goal percentage (0.48) compared to Florida (0.47). In terms of three-point shooting, Florida has a higher success rate (0.35) than Auburn (0.37). Both teams are quite evenly matched in terms of free throw percentage, with Florida at 0.72 and Auburn at 0.74.\n\nFlorida appears to have an advantage in rebounding, averaging 42.00 rebounds per game compared to Auburn's 37.10. However, Auburn has a higher number of assists per game (16.50) than Florida (15.90). Defensively, both teams are strong, holding their opponents to around 69 points per game. Florida's opponents have a slightly lower three-point percentage (0.30) compared to Auburn's opponents (0.29), indicating a potentially stronger three-point defense.",
