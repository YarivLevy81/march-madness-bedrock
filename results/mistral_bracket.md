--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Championship: 

Florida (Seed 1) vs Auburn (Seed 1) -> Florida

Reasoning: 

The key factors in this matchup appear to be offensive efficiency, rebounding, and three-point shooting. While Auburn has a slightly better field goal percentage, Florida's higher scoring average and better three-point shooting could give them an offensive edge. Florida's rebounding strength could also provide them with more second-chance points, which could be crucial in a close game.
