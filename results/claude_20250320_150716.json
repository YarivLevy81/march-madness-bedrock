Saint Mary's limits opponents to 31% from three. If Alabama gets hot from outside, they'll be difficult to beat.\n\n3. **Rebounding battle**: Both teams are strong on the boards, but Saint Mary's has a significant edge in offensive rebounding (14.1 vs 12.0), which could lead to crucial second-chance points.\n\n4. **Defensive disparity**: The 20-point gap in points allowed (60.7 vs 81.0) shows Saint Mary's is significantly better defensively.\n\nHowever, Alabama's offensive firepower, superior athleticism, and ability to score in bunches will likely overcome Saint Mary's defensive approach. While Saint Mary's will keep it competitive with their disciplined play, Alabama's shooting volume and ability to create turnovers will ultimately prevail in a game that may be closer than their seeding suggests.\n\n## PREDICTION:\nAlabama"

Forcing turnovers with their aggressive defense (9.0 steals per game)\n4. Controlling tempo and keeping the score lower\n\nDuke's path to victory relies on:\n1. Maintaining their offensive efficiency against Houston's pressure\n2. Converting from 3-point range to stretch Houston's defense\n3. Limiting Houston's second-chance opportunities\n4. Capitalizing on their superior free throw shooting in a close game\n\nThe deciding factors will likely be:\n- Duke's ability to handle Houston's defensive pressure\n- Houston's ability to generate enough offense against Duke's solid defense\n- Which team can impose their preferred tempo\n\nWhile Houston's defense is exceptional, Duke's offensive firepower combined with their own strong defense gives them a slight edge. Duke's superior shooting efficiency and ball movement should allow them to generate enough quality looks even against Houston's elite defense.\n\n## PREDICTION:\nDuke"
